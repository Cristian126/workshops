# Developer Environment Setup

## üìñ Overview

Developing applications with the Uno Platform requires Visual Studio for Windows. On iOS and Android, the Uno Platform relies extensively on the Xamarin Native stack. On WebAssembly, the Uno Platform relies directly on the Mono-Wasm runtime.

If you are doing this workshop as part of a classroom, it is important to pre-install these components of Visual Studio for Windows before attendance, as you'll need to download upwards of 12Gb of software from Microsoft.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Software Installation
